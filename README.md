## Nsimbi Tracker

### Overview
A smart, intuitive AI & Machine Learning powered application/solution that attempts to free the user from as much as possible the burden of manual calculation while keeping track of their expenditure easily with Artificial Intelligece (AI) assisted Financial Management & Advice. 

**Note:** This project is currently still a **Work In Progress** ðŸ˜Š

### Motivation
58.9% of Ugandans donâ€™t care how they spend money as stated in a report by Bank Of Uganda(BoU), according to [Dorothy Nakaweesi, 16 May 2022(Daily Monitor)](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/finance/58-9-of-ugandans-don-t-care-how-they-spend-money-bou-3816478). "More than half of working adult Ugandans, which represents 58.9 percent do not care how they spend their money". Poor spending habbits are mostly a direct result of lack of financial literacy according to [Eronie Kamukama, 03 January 2021](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/prosper/how-financial-literacy-improves-spending-habits-1665146) who believes that "financial literacy improves spending habits". The need to bridge this gap using technology gave birth to the idea of **Nsimbi Smart Finance Tracker**. 

With the help of this solution, a user can manage their expenses on a daily, weekly and monthly basis while also augumenting their financial literacy with Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted Financial Management and Advice.
