## Nsimbi Smart Finance Tracker

### Overview
An intuitive AI & Machine Learning powered application/solution that attempts to free the user from as much as possible the burden of manual calculation while keeping track of their expenditure easily with assisted Financial Management & Advice. The project was built from scratch using tools & technologies like, [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet), [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for Data Access, [MediatR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MediatR/), [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) for Domain model and Data Transfer Object mapping, [Fluent Validation](https://fluentvalidation.net/), [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) for Unit Tests in ASP.NET Core, React.js using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and [MVC-Razor Pages](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc) for Frontend Client Applications, [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) for cloud services.

**Note:** This project is currently still a **Work In Progress** ðŸ˜Š

### Motivation
Instead of keeping a diary or a log of the expenses, this solution enables the user to not just keep the control on expenses but also to generate and save reports.

With the help of this solution, the user can manage their expenses on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Users can insert and delete transactions as well as can generate and save their reports. The goal is to have a solution that appeals to the user more and is easy to understand.

## System Architecture 
This System currently uses the Layered/N-Tier Architectural pattern and also follows the [Onion Architecture (Clean Architecture)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and Domain Driven Design (DDD) guidelines for it's implementation.
