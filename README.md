### Motivation

58.9% of Ugandans donâ€™t care how they spend money as stated in a report by Bank Of Uganda(BoU), according to [Dorothy Nakaweesi, 16 May 2022(Daily Monitor)](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/finance/58-9-of-ugandans-don-t-care-how-they-spend-money-bou-3816478). "More than half of working adult Ugandans, which represents 58.9 percent do not care how they spend their money". Poor spending habbits are mostly a direct result of lack of financial literacy according to [Eronie Kamukama, 03 January 2021](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/prosper/how-financial-literacy-improves-spending-habits-1665146) who believes that "financial literacy improves spending habits". The need to bridge this gap using technology gave birth to the idea of **Nsimbi Manager**. 

With the help of this Technology, you can manage and keep track of your personal finances on a daily, weekly and monthly basis while also augmenting your financial literacy with Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted Financial Management.
