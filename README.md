### Motivation
58.9% of Ugandans donâ€™t care how they spend money according to Bank Of Uganda according to [Dorothy Nakaweesi, Monday, May 16, 2022(Daily Monitor)](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/finance/58-9-of-ugandans-don-t-care-how-they-spend-money-bou-3816478). "More than half of working adult Ugandans, which represents 58.9 percent do not care how they spend their money, according to a report by Bank of Uganda (BoU).". This is mostly a direct result of lack of financial literacy. According to [Eronie Kamukama, 03 January, 2021](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/prosper/how-financial-literacy-improves-spending-habits-1665146), "financial literacy improves spending habits". The need to bridge this gap gave birth to the idea of **Nsimbi Smart Finance Tracker**. 

With the help of this solution, the user can manage their expenses on a daily, weekly and monthly basis as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted Financial Management and Advice.
